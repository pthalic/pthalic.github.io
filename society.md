Social Sciences deal with individuals, their relationships and their society. They seek to understand the realm of human experience within the framework of social structures. To this end, they seek to quantify their findings through theories and methods provided by the natural and formal sciences respectively. As the social sciences address issues a lot more complex and contextual than the natural phenomena, theories constructed are malleable and frequently subject to change.
