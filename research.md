My research is primarily focused on complex systems and its diverse, interdisciplinary incarnations. I find the dynamics and properties of such interconnected networks extremely fascinating. I mainly use tools and terminology from systems theory to understand the complexity found in biology and society. I am also interested in looking at the brain from a computational and modelling perspective.
