There is a level of human experience beyond the reach of the scientific method which deals with aesthetics, philosophy and literature and are collectively mentioned under the rubric "culture" or "humanities". The analysis is a lot more finer and subtle compared to the other bodies of knowledge due to the subjective nature of the knowledge.  Residing on a higher abstraction level, the study and appreciation of Humanities is considered unimportant in the fast moving world of ours. Yet, the human experience is incomplete and drab without it.
